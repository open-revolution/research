Detailed explanation of why markets struggle to produce, allocate or distribute information goods.

1. Pure "market" would mean no monopoly rights. It would just mean rights over what you possess. (? not sure this wants to come first)

Fundamental theorem of welfare economics:

1. non-convex production functions - no fixed costs and stable or increasing marginal costs 
2. complete information and markets (about the future)
3. everyone price takers (no monopoly)

How do information goods compare?

(1) all fixed costs, no marginal costs => complete violation of condition 1

(2) many goods are experience goods, future hugely uncertain and unknown (who imagined the iphone and when)

(3) monopoly rights => a monoply => not a price taker. If we go for market competition 

At simplest level "market" is synonymous with competition. But the very essence of monopoly rights is to eliminate traditional competition - only one person has the right to supply the cancer drug or harryp potter. the competition we do get is "monopolistic competition" between different goods not between instances of the good.
