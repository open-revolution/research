New feedback 2017-12-14 - from Rufus

* Excellent work. These cover a wide range of proposals and give a good overview.
* I'd do more citation of sources (maybe via footnotes) plus excerpting from actual proposals themselves. This might be more in a notes or fuller description section but could also be appropriate in summary esp if summary is all we have.
* Not sure strengths / weaknesses section work so well - at same time I do find them useful. Still thinking about best approach here. One idea might be that rather than trying to evaluate it is probably better just to score against our overall criteria on mechanisms and on stuff like politics to have that separately (or not at all).

Formatting / markdown:

* space after headings
* 2 space indents in bullets
* **bold** not <u>underline</u> and avoid html like `<u>`
* citations: shall we move to use citation references rather than hand typing out (it will also make it easier to manage)
  * I have now written up the recommendations on this ...

## Health Impact Fund

* Start date: Proposed in 2008.
* Description: A proposal to create a fund to pay for pharmaceutical innovation according to health impact.
* Status: Proposed.

### Summary

The Health Impact Fund is a proposal to create a fund to pay for pharmaceutical innovation according to health impact. It is a project of Incentives for Global Health, which in turn is a project of the Global Justice Program.

HIF would be an optional fund functioning alongside current patents and other rights. Pharmaceutical companies could choose to register a new drug with HIF. The drug would then be sold at cost price, and the company reimbursed from the fund in proportion to the health benefit created by the drug. Health impact would be measured in QALYs. Registration would expire after 10 years. Payments would be made annually.

The HIF team estimate that $6 billion would be a reasonable annual minimum level of funding. This money would come from states which join the HIF. The HIF team estimate that a threshold of one third of all states would be needed before the HIF could become operational.

### Notes

#### Strengths and weaknesses

**Scope:** HIF covers all medicines and would remunerate all aspects of research leading to drug production. In practice however as the system is optional, it would particularly target diseases of the poor (where the health impact is likely to be greater than potential profit).

> [name=Rufus Pollock] i'd avoid term "production" either say research or manufacturing to clearly distinguish (and if you mean both say both of them)

**Access:** The cost of drugs would reduce under HIF. Distribution would also be incentivised as remuneration would be proportionate to health impact.

**Innovation:** Incentives would be directly linked to health impact. The level of incentive would be regulated by the market: as HIF would be optional, there would be an inbuilt adjustment mechanism for regulating the level of remuneration given.

> I'm not sure [name=Rufus Pollock]

**Efficiency:** HIF would require substantial funding and be expensive to run.

> [name=Rufus Pollock] Why would it be expensive to run. We are talking about the mechanism here. And would it be more expensive than current monopoly patents system and in what ways?

**Governability:** HIF would require extensive multinational governance, which would be difficult to implement. It also rests on the accurate measurement of health impact.

> [name=Rufus Pollock] can you give a bit of detail and why. I would also be a bit more cautious in wording on these ones e.g. HIF would require new international governance mechanisms. This could be difficult to implement though the implmentation model of international cooperation around R&D is already proven in the form of the international IP agreements.

**Political Feasibility:** HIF functions alongside traditional IP. However as it is a comprehensive and multinational proposal, it might still be very hard to implement.

#### Relation to other proposals

> [name=Rufus Pollock] spaces after headings ;-)

* The Australian Democrats Prize Proposal is very similar to HIF.
* MIPF also envisaged a fund which remunerates based on health impact. However, MIPF proposed a compulsory fund which would entirely replace the patent system. In addition, MIPF would only operate in the US.
* The Donor Prize Fund would be optional and disease neutral, like HIF. Unlike HIF, it would be funded by a set percentage of donor outlay, rather than government funding. Unlike HIF, remuneration would be tied to openness of information, rather than health impact.
* FRIND and the PDP+ Fund proposed creating a fund which remunerates innovators on the condition that they promote access to their drug.
* The Cancer Innovation Fund is disease specific, unlike HIF, and would presumably be compulsory.
* HIF is like a much farther-reaching MPP or patent pool: innovators volunteer to join a pool, but the condition of joining is much lower barriers to access.
* The effect of HIF is similar to the effect of the Chagas and TB Prize Funds (drugs are available more cheaply and innovators are paid via a fund), only more generalised. Instead of winning only a prize, under HIF innovators win long-term remuneration rights, and instead of targeting one disease, HIF concerns medicines in general.

#### Political strategy

* Targeted at:
    * Governments, particularly the US
    * International bodies
* Stakeholders on board:
    * The Global Justice Program, which is an interdisciplinary group at Yale led by Thomas Pogge
    * Incentives for Global Health, which is a non-profit organisation with the purpose of forwarding HIP, made up of an international and interdisciplinary group of scholars
    * The SDP in Germany endorse the HIP
    * The WHO Expert Working Group on Research and Development Financing recommended further investigation

#### A detailed point

* Pogge and Hollis estimate that in wealthy countries the annual per capita cost of HIF would be $12 (Adrian Hollis and Thomas Pogge, *The Health Impact Fund: Making New Medicines Accessible for All* (Innovation for Global Health, 2008), pp. 10-11). This is the same amount that Rufus estimates it would cost to open music in 'Blueprint for an Open World'. How can these numbers agree?

> a) Good question (btw: numbers info like this are really important so do note them) b) I imagine this is low because fund ends up just supporting neglected diseases and this is developed countries contribution [name=Rufus Pollock]

#### Comparison of HIF book and Open this Book

> I'd delete this section from the summary. However, I'd be interested to get more info from you on this. [name=Rufus Pollock]

* HIF is more scholarly
  * > In what way? This is useful to understand [name=Rufus Pollock]
  * > Style mainly. Greater use of footnotes, explicit positioning with regards current economic theories and alternative proposals, more obviously rigorous logical structure and signposting, fewer anecdotes. [name=Rose Hadshar]
* HIF frames itself strongly as both a benefit to the affluent and a solution to the problem of global health. Open this Book is currently more in the 'benefit to the affluent' vein. The core anecdotes are about wealthy people without access to drugs, and much of the book is devoted to luxury information goods like music.
  * > Re "benefit the affluent" That is interesting. Could you elaborate :-) [name=Rufus Pollock]

## The 3P Project
* Start date: Proposed in 2015.
* Description: A package of incentives to encourage the creation of a one-month TB regimen which is affordable for all.
* Status: Proposed (seeking funding to launch in 2017).

### Summary
The 3P project is a project to increase the creation of and access to tuberculosis drugs. Specifically, it aims to create a one-month TB regimen which is affordable for everyone.

The project seeks decouple the cost of R&D from the price of the ensuing treatement, through prizes, grants and the pooling of IP (pull, push, pool).

The precise mechanism envisaged is that companies will apply to the 3P Project for either a prize or a grant. They will then be asked to pool their data, and be considered firstly by a scientific committee and then a steering committee, which will decide whether to allocate the prize/grant. It also envisages creating a patent pool for the regimen created under the auspices of the project.

The 3P Project is run by a consortium of anti-TB organisations, led by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD). MSF were instumental in starting the project.

### Notes
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> The 3P Project is limited to one set of TB treatments. It would impact all areas of research for those treatments.

<u>Access:</u> Via a patent pool, the 3P Project would increase competition and lower prices. The project does not explicitly set out how it would incentivise distribution, but this might be through donor commitment.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not directly linked to health impacts.

<u>Efficiency:</u> It is not clear how costly the 3P Project would be.

<u>Governability:</u> Given the variety of mechanisms involved, it is likely that the 3P Project would need substantial governance. The prize mechanism will also require price setting and product specification, which are difficult to do correctly.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> As the 3P Project coexists alongside patents, this makes it easier to implement. It also has the backing of a wide range of NGOs

#### Relation to other proposals
* As a composite project, the 3P Project contains elements of many other proposals.
* Both FRIND and the 3P Project share the idea of raising funds which are disbursed for the late-stage creation of neglected drugs on condition of affordability. The 3P Project has a more composite mechanism and a more targeted disease area than FRIND.
* The 3P Project is composite and disease focused, like the Chagas prize. It too would involve both a patent pool and prizes for specific products. The 3P Project also envisages direct funding of research, which is not part of the Chagas prize. The TB Prize proposal is essentially the same as the Chagas prize.
* The 3P Project envisages direct funding of research. Selection would be based on scientific assessment. This is similar to PDPs.
* The 3P Project includes a requirement to pool information. This is comparable to The Pool for Open Innovation against Neglected Tropical Diseases and MIPF.
* The 3P Project would incorporate a patent pool (see MPP, The Pool for Open Innovation against Neglected Tropical Diseases, Essential Patent Pool for AIDS). If FRIND operated a system of license exclusivity for FRIND, then it too would become a patent pool.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * TB organisations
    * WHO
* Stakeholders on board:
    * Core members of the Steering Group: TB Alliance (TBA), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Stop TB Partnership (STBP), The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease (The Union), the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), the Critical Path Institute (C-PATH) and an individual nominated by civil society groups (CS)
    * The WHO’s Global TB Programme sits as a permanent observer to the Steering Committee
    * The 3P Project was presented to the World Economic Forum on Africa in May 2017

#### Misc
* Reasons that such a regimen has so far not been developed commercially, in addition to the poverty of many TB sufferers, are that:
    * There are high risks and costs to testing multiple drugs and combination treatments.
  * Consequently, companies have focused on drugs rather than regimen.
  * There are also pipeline problems in progressing drugs to late-stage trials
* This suggests that a proposal that incentivises the creation of non-commercially viable drugs might have a particularly strong effect on diseases which require multiple treatments, and on improving pipelines.

### Summary

> I believe this is Jamie Love's work ;-) I think it is a continuation / similar to earlier stuff see https://blog.okfn.org/2004/10/30/the-medical-innovation-convention-a-new-global-framework-for-healthcare-research-and-development/ [name=Rufus Pollock]
> As with a lot of Jamie's work, it's hard to find evidence that there is a link. I can find claims that the Medical Innovation Convention/MRDT was the originator. However, I can't find any confirmatory evidence. Unless I find some evidence of this, I'll just put that MIPF builds conceptually on MIC/MRDT, rather than stating that it is a direct continuation. [name=Rose Hadshar]
> I had this comment more as a piece of info to you than something we include in the summary. I know for a fact this is Love's work but this is not something we need to (or should) mention. [name=Rufus Pollock]

The Medical Innovation Prize Fund has been proposed in a series of acts by Senator Bernie Sanders in the US.

It is a comprehensive scheme designed to replace the patent system. It would establish a government fund which would reward innovators according to the health impact achieved by their innovations. Under this system, patents would only function to secure eligibility for funding, and would not confer exclusive rights.

The funds would be spent on a combination of end product prizes, allocations of funds to priority research, open source dividend prizes and prizes for interim research. Drugs would be eligible for the fund for a period of 10 years. Where a drug formed the basis of a follow-on drug, it would receive an appropriate portion of the associated reward.

> Can you go into a bit more detail here. E.g. what is an open source dividend? How are the funds allocated (Ah, i now see that below). I'd also recommend actually quoting from the proposal if needed. NB: this may be material for the notes rather than summary. If so, may be worth on key points like this to mention that further details are below. [name=Rufus Pollock]

The system would be administered by a board of trustees and six expert advisory boards. There would also be a system of competitive intermediaries, who would compete for funding and allocate some of the rewards. Funds would come from the treasury at the rate of 0.55% GDP annually.

### Notes

#### Details

* Sponsors of the fund claim that it is TRIPS compliant.
  * > Where is this claimed - could you footnote or link [name=Rufus Pollock]
* S. 1138 in 2011 was an act proposing a fund for HIV/AIDS specifically (so no HIV/AIDS drugs could be patented).
* The sponsors of the 2011 act estimated that the scheme would reduce the cost of drugs in the US by more than $250 billion.
  * > Again can you cite in a footnote the source for this. [name=Rufus Pollock]
* The six expert advisory boards would be for:
    * Economic evaluation of therapeutic benefits.
    * Business models and incentive structures for innovation.
    * Research and development priorities.
    * Orphan diseases.
    * Financial control and auditing.
    * Open source biomedical science.
* The following minimum spending levels for the fund were suggested:
    * 5% on open source dividend prizes
    * 4% for neglected global diseases (via funding of prior research)
    * 10% for orphan drugs (via funding of prior research)
    * 4% for global infectious diseases and other global health priorities (via funding of prior research)
* The acts all ended up being referred to committees.
  > do we know what happened in committee? [name=Rufus Pollock]
* The acts are not specific on what adjudicatory mechanisms there would be in the case of litigation relating to the fund.
* To evaluate remuneration levels, MIPF proposes using:
    * the number of patients affected
    * the expected life cycle benefits of the products (in cases of drug resistance)
    * risk adjusted benefits (in the case of stockpiled products)
    * the incremental therapeutic benefit of the drug
    * the extent to which the following priorities are met:
        * global infectious diseases
        * severe illnesses with small client populations
        * neglected diseases primarily affecting the poor
    * improved efficiency of manufacturing processes
    * extent of openness

> Below you indicate that this proposal is oriented around health impact. Can you add a bullet about this with some detail and actual cites from the act. [name=Rufus Pollock]

> You also mention that openness is a criterion along with QALYs. Again can you quote and ref relevant sections. Note also that our proposal (and i believe HIF) *require* openness so you could say it was a criterion - just a compulsory one. [name=Rufus Pollock]

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

<u>Scope:</u> MIPF would cover all disease areas and all R&D within the US.

<u>Access:</u> MIPF would lower the cost of drugs and incentivise distribution, as remuneration would be based on health impact.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives would be directly linked to health impact, as well as to other factors. A large amount of money would be provided, and it would not compete with patents as a funding source, but there would be no market adjustment in the scale of the incentive.

<u>Efficiency:</u> MIPF would cost 0.55% of US GDP, which is very expensive - but could save even more. The system of competitive intermediaries also creates competition in the methodology for allocating funds.

<u>Governability:</u> MIPF would require a body to administer the fund and many advisory committees. There is no inbuilt adjustment mechanism for setting remuneration levels, so this would be challenging.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> It is not clear whether this would be TRIPS compliant. As it is comprehensive and compulsory, it would be hard to implement.

#### Relation to other proposals

> 2 space indent for bullets please ;-) [name=Rufus Pollock]

* MIPF is similar to MIC/MRDT. These proposals envisaged a comprehensive prize system funded by government. Differences are:
    * MRDT would be international, MIPF national.
    * MRDT focused on funding levels or input, rather than health impact or output.
    * MRDT would be an optional fund.
* MIPF is similar to HIF. Like HIF, MIPF is a fund which remunerates innovators based on health impact. MIPF and HIF also envisage a fixed period of 10 years' participation in the fund. Differences are that:
    * MIPF relates to the US only, whereas HIF is international.
    * MIPF is compulsory, HIF is optional.
        * This in turn means that MIPF would cover a wider range of drugs, including rich world drugs, as companies would not be able to opt out if the profits from market sale were higher than the health impact provided.
    * HIF envisages using one measure, QALYs, to allocate remuneration rights. MIPF proposes a composite of many measures, including openess of information.
        * The above leads to the question: are QALYs too narrow a measure, or is it the most comprehensive measure and the least open to political abuse?
* The Australian Democrats Prize Proposal is  similar to MIPF, but optional and international in scope.
* FRIND and the PDP+ Fund differ from MIPF in that they target only neglected diseases, and remuneration would be tied only to the extent that access to the drugs were promoted.
* The Cancer Innovation Fund is disease specific, unlike MIPF.
* The Donor Prize Fund would be disease neutral, like MIPF. Unlike MIPF, it would be optional, and funded by a set percentage of donor outlay, rather than government funding. Remuneration would be tied to openness of information only, rather than a composite measure including health impact.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * US Senate and House of Representatives
* Stakeholders on board:
    * Bernie Sanders

## Advanced Market Commitment for Pneumococcal Vaccines

* Start date: Launched in 2007.
* Description: A scheme where donors precomit to subsidise the price of pneumococcal vaccines on development.
* Status: Operational.

### Summary
The AMC for pneumococcal vaccines is a pilot scheme designed to test the efficacy of Advanced Market Commitments.

Under the scheme, donors commit funds to guarantee the price of vaccines once they have been developed. This creates an incentive for manufacturers to invest in R&D. Companies who take up the offer of a subsidised price for their vaccine must commit to sell the vaccine at an affordable price.

Donor countries and philanthropies make grants to the World Bank, which disburses money to GAVI. GAVI passes this money on to manufacturers who have passed the application process and have won a supply agreement.

> I think this is a case where the summary needs some extension and rewriting e.g.
> * Under the scheme => is this AMCs or this specific AMC. I assume former i.e. you mean "Under an AMC schema, donoros ..."
> * What is GAVI? Suddenly comes up in 3rd paragraph
> * What are pneumococcal vaccines. In general I think some context (or even separate section in summary) on the health issue would be useful (not only here but e.g. around TB for 3P). I could even imagine these could be separated and form part of the "broader view of the health landscape" and then we ref from relevant proposals. [name=Rufus Pollock]

### Notes
#### Details
* In 2005 the CGD published a report on AMCs.
  * > CGD = ??. BTW I think we want a simple glossary / acronym DB! [name=Rufus Pollock]
* In 2006 the G8 launched a consultative process for a pilot.
* In 2007 a pilot was launched with Gates Foundation money.
* In 2009 the pneumococcal vaccine AMC became operational.
* In 2010 the first long-term manufacturing commitments were made.
* Impact evaluation of the pnemococcal AMC suggests that:
    * A low-income country market for vaccines was successfully created
    * The AMC did not accelerate R&D outcomes
    * Supply shortages were rectified more quickly because of the AMC

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

<u>Scope:</u> AMCs are disease specific. The pneumococcal AMC targeted late-stage development. In theory an AMC could be run for basic research, but this has not been proven.

<u>Access:</u> The cost of the drug is reduced through AMCs. They also incentivise distribution via donors' commitments to purchase and distribute drugs.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not directly linked to health impact. AMCs could possibly reduce competition and therefore innovation. It is not clear whether the incentives offered are strong enough: in the case of the pneumococcal AMC, it seems that R&D outcomes were not accelerated.

<u>Efficiency:</u> AMCs require a large amount of funding.

<u>Governability:</u> AMCs require a large amount of administration. They also require narrow specification, which is difficult to do correctly. It is also hard to set the price in advance without reference to the market.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> AMCs are attractive to industry and to beneficiaries, as they maintain IP while increasing access.

#### Relation to other proposals

* The pneumococcal vaccine AMC is a kind of AMC or APC.
* GAVI manages the pneumococcal AMC.
* The US Project BioShield, which aims to reduce the risk of bioterrorism, created a fund to be spent on vaccines and other drugs for the national stockpile. Although not a formal AMC commitment, this acts as a similar kind of incentive.
* An AMC is a similar mechanism to a prize. Unlike most prizes, AMCs do solve the distribution problem, through donors' commitment to purchase and then distribute drugs.
    * The Chagas and TB Prizes would also solve the distribution problem by making the prize conditional on health impact and market presence.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * International organisations
    * Philanthropists
    * Drugs companies
* Stakeholders on board:
    * GAVI
    * UNICEF
    * WHO
    * CGD
    * Gates Foundation
    * G8

## Priority Review Vouchers

* Start date: Proposed in 2006, launched in 2007.
* Description: A US scheme where companies who create neglected drugs are given a voucher for use on another drug which will expedite the FDA review process.
* Status: Operational.

### Summary
In 2007, PRVs were included as the Elimination of Neglected Diseases Amendment in the FDA Amendments Act. This created a scheme whereby if a company created a drug for a neglected disease, they could apply to be rewarded with a PRV. This could then be used to expedite the review process on another drug. PRVs can also be sold to other drugs companies.

PRVs were initially proposed in a paper by Ridley, Grabowski, and Moe in 2006. The original proposal included compulsory non-patenting of the neglected drug, but the final act did not.

In 2012, the PRV scheme was extended to rare paediatric diseases.

The estimated value of a voucher is $100-300 million.

### Notes
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> PRVs in the US apply to neglected diseases and rare paediatric diseases. They relate to final products.

<u>Access:</u> There is no impact on the price of drugs. PRVs do not incentivise distribution.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not linked to health impact. The reward of PRVs is such that it is unlikely to incentivise full-blown ND research. It is more likely that they speed up ND research that would have happened anyway.

<u>Efficiency:</u> The PRV system is very cheap to administer (though not actually costless).

<u>Governability:</u> The PRV system uses existing FDA administration, so is relatively light of governance. It requires specification of which drugs count as neglected, but from that point on is relatively straightforward to administer.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> PRVs are patent compatible, and have been successfully implemented.

#### Relation to other proposals
* A PRV is a kind of Transferable Fast Track (TFT).
* Transferable Intellectual Property Rights (TIPR) are similar, but instead of granting expedited review in exchange for the development of a neglected drug, companies are granted market exclusivity. An examples of a TIPR style proposal is the US paediatric initiative.
* Ridley and Sanchez also proposed an EU PRV system in 2010. In addition to accelerating market authorisation like the US scheme, the EU scheme would also accelerate pricing and reimbursement decisions, as the EMA unlike the FDA has considerable control over this. Under the US scheme PRVs can only be sold once, but Ridley and Sanchez proposed for the EU scheme that PRVs be transferrable multiple times.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Drugs companies
    * The FDA
    * The US government
* Stakeholders on board:
    * FDA
    * Ridley, Grabowski, and Moe

## GAVI Alliance

* Start date: Launched in 2000.
* Description: A PDP focused on vaccines for children, which pools the demand of poorer countries and is financed partly through donor funding and partly through recipient country contributions.
* Status: Operational.

### Summary
GAVI is a public private partnership for the procurement and distribution of vaccines. It pools donor funds, money raised by IFFIm via donor-backed bonds, and developing country contributions, and then uses this money to purchase and deliver vaccines.

> IFFIm? [name=Rufus Pollock]

GAVI represents over 60 developing countries, and acts to pool their demand and represent this to drugs companies. This incentivises drugs companies to develop vaccines. GAVI then funds the purchase and delivery of these vaccines by developing country actors.

### Notes
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> GAVI covers vaccines only, and does not directly fund R&D.

<u>Access:</u> GAVI increases access via funding the purchase and distribution of drugs. This also incentivises distribution.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not directly linked to health impact, although GAVI countries are developing economies and so it is likely that GAVI does have a positive impact through incentivising otherwise neglected research.

<u>Efficiency:</u> GAVI is funded by donors and by money raised on the capital markets, and so is fairly efficient. GAVI does not have in-country staff or manage the delivery of vaccines itself. This makes it more cost-effective as it avoids duplication.

<u>Governability:</u> GAVI requires a governance system to prioritise between vaccines.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> GAVI has wide political support.

#### Relation to other proposals
* GAVI is partly funded through the IFFIm. This sells donor-backed bonds on the capital market to raise money for GAVI. Other sources of funding are direct matching by DFID and the Gates foundation, developing country contributions, and other direct funding.
* Alongside the IFFim, there are a number of other proposals which involve donor-backed bond funding.
    * The PDF-FF proposes a donor-backed bond funding system for PDPs. It is more comprehensive than IFFIm, as it would include the selection of which PDPs to fund, whereas the IFFIm simply channels all money to GAVI.
      * > What is PDF-FF? [name=Rufus Pollock]
    * The IRFF - Industry R&D Facilitation Fund is similar to the PDF-FF. It would commit to reimbursing a certain proportion of the expenses of PDPs (say 80%) using bond-backed financing.
* GAVI is partially funded through contributions from developing countries. This is similar to FRIND’s funding model of contributions from countries without the capacity for portfolio management.
* PDPs tend to be fairly composite in approach. This is true of GAVI, which operates the pneumoccocal AMC as well as providing a more general incentive to vaccine developers, through directly purchasing vaccines.
* Traditional PDPs tend to fund research directly, unlike GAVI. This makes them especially good at funding basic research, and popular with researchers. It also means they are less efficient, as unsuccessful research is funded and they do not provide incentives to research cost-effectively. Moreover, the discoveries made through PDPs are then often patented, such that the public pays twice.
* Other examples of PDPs include  ANDI, IMI - Innovative Medicines Initiative, Lygature, PATH, TI Pharma, 2004 agreement between the International Partnership for Microbicides and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, a Belgian subsidiary of pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, to develop a microbicide to protect women from infection with HIV, Meningitis Vaccine Project, Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, CD4 Initiative, Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, DVI - Dengue Vaccine Initiative, EVI - European Vaccine Initiative, FIND - Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, GDAC - Global Dengue & Aedes-Transmitted Diseases Consortium, Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative, IAVI - International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, IDRI - Infectious Disease Research Institute, International Partnership for Microbicides, iOWH - Institute for One World Health, IVCC, IVI - International Vaccine Institute, Malaria Vaccine Initiative, MMV - Medicines for Malaria Venture, PDVI - Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative, TB Alliance, TBVI - TB Vaccine Initiative, and the WHO’s Tropical Disease Research.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Vaccine developers
    * Developing countries
    * Donors (governments and philanthropies)
* Stakeholders on board:
    * Permanent members of the board:
        *  WHO
        *  UNICEF
        *  World Bank

## FRIND - the Fund for Research in Neglected Tropical Diseases
* Start date: Proposed in 2009.
* Description: A fund for R&D into neglected diseases which awards remuneration to innovators provided that their drugs are sold affordably.
* Status: Proposed.

### Summary

FRIND is a pooled fund proposed by Novartis to fund late-stage research into neglected diseases. The proposal was submitted to the EWG in 2009 and the CEWG in 2011.

Initially the fund would focus on attracting funds from governments without the capacity for portfolio management. This is meant to enable smaller donors to direct their funds to the most promising opportunities.

The fund would use portfolio management techniques to select the most promising compounds with the help of a scientific advisory committee.

Applicants to the pool would have to ensure that drugs developed using FRIND funding were affordable. FRIND proposed a possible mechanism whereby exclusive licensing rights would be granted to FRIND itself, which would thereby create a kind of ND patent pool.

### Notes
#### Details
In the original proposal, FRIND was envisaged as becoming the dominant funder of ND research. Due to lack of enthusiasm from donors, the second proposal was scaled back. The fund would start with $50-100millon, and then increase up to double that amoount if successful. In 2012, $200 million was less than 10% of non-HIV/AIDS ND research [CEWG report].

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> FRIND focuses on NDs, which are likely to be among the most cost-effective funding opportunities (though this also means that FRIND would not directly impact the wider R&D funding landscape). Unlike similar funds, FRIND proposes to fund all kinds of research organisation, rather than only PDPs. FRIND focuses on late stage research only, which means it would exert limited influence over early stage research.

<u>Access:</u> As FRIND subsidises research, it delinks to a certain extent. FRIND also envisages some kind of commitment to affordibility on the part of fundees, so drug prices would reduce at least somewhat. However, FRIND does not include any incentive for distribution.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not directly linked to health impact, although the focus on NDs and on portfolio management might well lead to an increase in health impact. The incentives for new innovation would be fairly weak, as the fund targets only late-stage research which is more likely to be undertaken anyway, if at a later date.

<u>Efficiency:</u> FRIND is a relatively cheap proposal: $50-100m to begin with. However, this also means that FRIND would be a small funding player with limited reach.

<u>Governability:</u> FRIND proposes a scientific advisory board as the main mechanism of governance. This seems feasible. Prioritising between different compounds as part of portfolio management would be difficult but again seems feasible.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> A lack of enthusiasm among large donors led the FRIND proposal to be scaled down. It also seems unlikely that smaller governments would be willing to cede control over funding decisions to FRIND, as this would require a high degree of value alignment. However, it is  true that FRIND is backed by a pharmaceutical company, and so may be in a better position to generate industry support.

#### Relation to other proposals
* The PDP+ Fund is the most similar to the FRIND proposal, except that it would only be used to fund PDPs.
* The 3P Project and FRIND share the idea of raising funds which are disbursed for the late-stage creation of neglected drugs on condition of affordability. The 3P Project has a more composite mechanism and a more targeted disease area than FRIND.
* If FRIND were implemented with exclusive licensing to FRIND itself, it would become a patent pool as well as a fund, like the MPP, the 3P Project, and the Chagas and TB Prizes (see also The Pool for Open Innovation against Neglected Tropical Diseases and the Essential Patent Pool for AIDS).
* Other pooled funding mechanisms (on a much larger scale) are MRDT, the global framework, the Australian Democrats Prize Proposal and HIF.
* FRIND is a fund which awards grants conditional on some commitment to access. HIF and MIPF are similar, but rather than awarding funds conditionally in advance, they award remuneration retrospectively based on health impact (which has an obvious relation to access). HIF and MIPF are both comprehensive proposals, rather than focusing on a NDs. The Australian Democrats Prize Proposal is similar to HIF and MIPF in these respects.
* The Cancer Innovation Fund and FRIND are both disease specific international funds. CIF is aimed explicitly at comprehensive delinkage, and remunerates rather than funding up front.
* GAVI is partialy funded through contributions from developing countries. This is similar to FRIND's funding model of contributions from countries without the capacity for portfolio management.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Smaller governments
    * Innovators
    * Major donors
* Stakeholders on board:
    * Novartis

## CIF - Cancer Innovation Fund
* Start date: Proposed in 2017, dates back to 2008.
* Description: A proposal to delink R&D costs from drug and vaccine prices in the case of cancer.
* Status: Proposed.

### Summary
The Cancer Innovation Fund is a label for a series of proposals to demonopolise cancer treatments, and remunerate innovators instead through a fund.

Proposals to this effect have taken various forms, including:
* A fund for the EU only
* A fund for likeminded countries
* Funding from national budgets for cancer treatments
* Funding from national budgets for the purchase of cancer drugs
* Funding from national budgets for healthcare
* Rewards in proportion to health impact

Such proposals have been discussed at the WHO and in 2017 a resolution was passed which mandated a feasability study into pricing approaches for cancer treatments.

### Notes
#### Details
* In 2008 Barbados and Bolivia made a proposal on cancer delinkage to the WHO.
* In 2009 Bangladesh, Bolivia and Suriname made a proposal on cancer delinkage to the WHO.
* In 2014 a proposal was discussed by actors in Europe for an EU wide cancer fund.
* In January 2017,  the WHO Executive Board discussed a proposed resolution on a cancer fund. References to delinkage were apparently removed at this point due to their controversial nature.
* A draft resolution was proposedto the WHO in May by Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Russia, Thailand and Zambia.
* In May, WHO members agreed to this resolution.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> The proposals focus on cancer treatments, which are not a relatively neglected health area. The proposals would affect all stages of R&D in the field of cancer.

<u>Access:</u> As the proposals would delink completely, competition would increase, drug prices decrease, and access increase. If rewards were linked to health impact, this would provide a distribution incentive.

<u>Innovation:</u> Some versions of this proposal suggest explicitly linking incentives to health impact. Removing all monopoly rights would create incentives for generic competition, and if a sufficiently large remuneration fund were established, this would incentivise new research.

<u>Efficiency:</u> This would be an expensive proposal. The 2014 EU proposal suggested a fund of 15.7 billion (currency unstated, presumed dollars).

<u>Governability:</u> Such a fund would require a multinational governance structure. Little work seems to have been done in developing proposals in this area. If remuneration were based on impact, this would require complex measurement.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> The US opposed any reference to delinkage in the WHO resolutions. Love commented that there is growing interest in Europe and the developing world for such a proposal. As it entirely does away with monopoly rights, it is unlikely to receive support from pharmaceutical companies.

#### Relation to other proposals
* Another fund that entirely does away with monopoly rights is MIPF. MIPF only concerns the US, unlike CIF, and affects all drugs, rather than just cancer.
* HIF and the Australian Democrats Prize Fund are comprehensive and optional versions of CIF.
* MRDT and the global framework are comprehensive international funds which do not replace monopoly rights.
* FRIND and the PDP+ Fund fund R&D upfront rather than via remuneration, and coexist with the patenting system. Like CIF, FRIND is an international and disease specific research fund.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Governments
    * WHO
* Stakeholders on board:
    * KEI
    * Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment (UACT)
    * Bangladesh, Bolivia, Barbados and Suriname

## MPP - Medicines Patent Pool
* Start date: Launched in 2010.
* Description: A patent pool which reduces the cost of drugs treating HIV, viral hepatitis C and tuberculosis.
* Status: Operational.

### Summary

The MPP is an organisation funded by UNITAID which negotiates directly with drugs companies to encourage them to voluntarily join an HIV/AIDS patent pool.

This makes it easier for fixed-dose combinations (which require licenses to multiple drugs) to be created. Moreover, generic manufacturers can obtain licenses more easily, which increases competition and reduces price.

The UNITAID model was submitted to the EWG in 2008, and the MPP was launched in 2010.

### Notes
#### Details
9 patent holders hold MPP agreements, 17 generic companies have been sublicensed, and 16 products are licensed to the MPP. The MPP now also includes some treatments relating to TB and HepC.

KPMG estimated that between 2012 and 2016, the MPP saved $312 million in treatment costs. In 2016, the MPP's total income was around $6.5m.

> How did they estimate these numbers? Worth a quick check. These numbers are incredibly useful as they start giving us numbers to use for the estimate of open approaches globally - esp if we go from simple money to lives saved (and to do that we need detail of KPMG estimates) [name=Rufus Pollock]

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> The MPP targets TB, HIV/AIDS and HepC. It affects only the licensing stage of research rather than the funding of research itself (though licensing in turn affects manufacture and some late-stage development).

<u>Access:</u> By making it easier for generics to obtain licenses, and therefore increasing competition, the MPP reduces the price of the drugs in its pool. It does not incentivise distribution.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not directly linked to health impact. Because the MPP targets diseases which mostly affect the poor, it may well still have a net positive health impact.

<u>Efficiency:</u> The MPP is fairly cheap to run and also makes the licensing process in general more cost-effective.

<u>Governability:</u> The MPP is successfully managed by a governance board and an expert advisory group. As a model it does not require complex global governance. As it targets the licensing stage, it is also in possession of relatively good information on the drugs required, so selection is not so great an issue.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> The MPP inhabits the current patent system, and has proved fairly easy to implement. There are also other examples of patent pools which have been successfully implemented.

#### Relation to other proposals
* The MPP is a "downstream" patent pool which targets patents related to treatment products. Traditional patent pools tend instead to be "upstream", and to focus on facilitating product development.
* If FRIND operated licensing exclusivity for FRIND itself, then it would become a patent pool similar to the MPP, but focused on NDs.
* The Chagas Disease Prize Fund explicitly cited the MPP as a possible model for its patent pool. The TB Prize is similar to the Chagas Prize.
* DEFEND, the Developing Economies’ Fund for Essential New Drugs, would be a fund to purchase licenses for drugs, which could then be produced and sold more cheaply. This is a similar idea to the MPP.
* The The Pool for Open Innovation against Neglected Tropical Diseases, superseded by WIPO's Re:Search, is an information and patent pool.
* The Essential Patent Pool for AIDS, proposed in 2005 by Love and others, is in essence a precursor of the MPP.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Patent holders
    * Generic drug companies
* Stakeholders on board:
    * UNITAID

## ODA - Orphan Drugs Act 1983
* Start date: Enacted in 1983.
* Description: A set of incentives included extended market exclusivity introduced by government to encourage the creation of drugs which affect a small number of people.
* Status: Operational.

### Summary
The US Orphan Drugs Act of 1983 created a premium pricing model for drugs with a small market. Specifically it targetted rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people.

To incentivise drugs companies to develop drugs for such diseases, the ODA offers companies extended exclusivity on any such drugs created, on the condition that the drugs are of sufficient quantity and quality. Companies are also granted tax credits in exchange for develping such drugs.

### Notes
#### Details
Before 1983, only 10 orphan drugs were made. From then until 2014, over 200 were developed.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> The ODA targets only diseases which affect a small number of people. This obviously limits its potential health impact. It applies to America, and affects the licensing of drugs (rather than directly funding research).

<u>Access:</u> The ODA functions to increase the price of drugs because it extends market exclusivity. There is a provision in the act that a sufficient quantity of an orphan drug must be produced, and beyond this there is no distribution incentive.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not linked to health impact. The incentives offered seem fairly strong: pharmaceutical companies are supportive and many new drugs have been developed.

<u>Efficiency:</u> The ODA is not a particularly costly scheme to create or administer. It requires the drugs covered to be defined, but other than this no in depth measurement.

<u>Governability:</u> The ODA is adminsitered by the FDA.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> ODAs have been successfully implemented in the USA and elsewhere. Pharmaceutical companies are supportive.

#### Relation to other proposals
* Other ODAs have been implemented by the EU, Japan, Australia and Singapore.
* The ODA includes tax credits. The Vaccines Research Relief programme in the UK also offered tax credits on R&D expenditure towards vaccines in neglected areas.
* The ODA primarily functions through extended market exclusivity. Another way of using market exclusivity to incentivise particular behaviours is Transferrable Intellectual Property Rights (TIPR), where exclusivity is granted on a drug of choice in exchange for the creation of a neglected drug.
* In 1997, under the Modernisation Act, the US introduced the Paediatric incentive scheme. This is very similar to ODA: it grants market exclusivity on drugs for adult consumption in exchange for trailing the drug on children. Rather than incentivising the creation of drugs, the paediatric incentive actually functions to incentivise drugs trials.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Pharmaceutical companies
* Stakeholders on board:
    * The US government
    * The FDA
    * Pharmaceutical companies

## Chagas Disease Prize Fund

* Start date: Proposed in 2009.
* Description: A proposal to the WHO for a $250m prize system for Chagas disease, incorporating product prizes, technical challenge prizes and best contribution prizes.
* Status: Proposed.

### Summary

The Chagas Disease Prize Fund was a proposal to the WHO made in 2009 by Bangladesh, Barbados, Bolivia and Suriname.

The proposal envisaged three kinds of prize to be awarded by the fund:
* Chagas Disease Product Prizes (CDPP)
    * These would be awarded to qualifying products which entered developing markets and made a health impact.
    * Where multiple products qualified, the money would be distributed according to health impact.
* Technology Challenge Prizes
* Best Contribution Prizes

The Prize fund would also operate a patent pool which any prize recipients would be mandated to join.

The Prize fund would be funded by governments and donors. $250m was proposed as a figure for the fund. The prize would be held by the WHO or PAHO, and selection would be carried out by an expert committee.

In 2008 an earlier similar proposal was made by Barbados and Bolivia to the IGWG.

### Notes
#### Strengths and weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> This prize fund targets Chagas diseas only, which is a neglected disease. The fund would apply internationally, and would reward various stages of research.

<u>Access:</u> Through the patent pool mechanism, the Chagas Fund would increase competition and lower drug prices. Distribution is incentivised by making health impact a determinant of funds received, and by requiring drug entries to be available on developing markets.

<u>Innovation:</u> Some positive impact is mandatory for the receipt of the prize, and where more than one entry qualifies, the money will bedistributed according to health impact. Incentives for the main prize are thus reasonably linked to health impact. The incentives may well be reasonably strong, as according to the authors of the proposal very little other funding is available for Chagas. However, this remains unclear.

<u>Efficiency:</u> AT $250m, the fund woould require considerable investment.

<u>Governability:</u> The fund makes use of existing international governance structures, but would also require the creation of a specialist committee.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> Nothing came of the Chagas Fund proposal. This may be because international agreement is difficult to achieve, or because the proposal offers no material benefits to the citizens of wealthy nations.

#### Relation to other proposals
* The Chagas Disease Prize Fund explicitly cited the MPP as a possible model for its patent pool. The MPP functions through voluntary subscription by patent holders, whereas under the Chagas fund membership of the patent pool would be a condition of receiving the prize.
* The 3P proposal is composite and disease focused, like the Chagas prize. It too would involve both a patent pool and prizes for specific products. The 3P proposal also envisages direct funding of research, which is not part of the Chagas prize.
* The Chagas Disease Prize Fund bears similarities to both individual prize schemes and more comprehensive remuneration funds:

**Funds:**
* Like HIF, MIPF, CIF, and the Australian Democrats Prize Proposal, the Chagas Prize would remunerate innovators based on health impact. Unlike these funds, the Chagas Prize would award one-off prizes rather than long-term remuneration.

**Prizes:**
* In the same year as the Chagas Disease proposal, a nearly identical proposal was made to the WHO for TB.
* The Donor Prize Fund was also proposed in 2009. Like the Chagas Prize, this would create an optional innovation prize fund. Receipt of the prize would be conditional on the licensing of patents to generic suppliers, which is in effect what the Chagas patent pool would achieve.
* Many prizes do not focus on distribution like the Chagas Prize, and act more as incentives for research (see Armand Hammer Cancer Prize, Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, Gotham Prize for Cancer Research, The Kochon Prize). This is also true of Prize4Life and the Archon Genomics X-Prize.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * WHO
    * PAHO
    * WHO member states
* Stakeholders on board:
    * Bangladesh, Barbados, Bolivia and Suriname

## Prize4Life

* Start date: Launched in 2006.
* Description: A prize fund for ALS treatment.
* Status: Operational.

### Summary

Prize4Life is an organisation which gives prizes for specific achievements in the field of ALS/MND. It focuses on the gap between research and the healthcare industry, to incentivise the translation of scientific findings into useable treatments.

Prize4Life has awarded three prizes so far:
* a $1m prize for the development of a biomarker in 2011
* a $50,000 prediction prize to three winners in 2012
* a $1m treatment prize in 2017

Prize4Life prizes are brokered through the prize network InnoCentive.

### Notes
#### Strengths and weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> Prize4Life targets one disease and one area of research (ALS and the gap between research and product development specifically).

<u>Access:</u> Prize4Life does not function to reduce the cost of treatment or to incentivise distribution.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not directly linked to health impact. It is not clear how strong incentives are, though Prize4Life does receive multiple submissions.

<u>Efficiency:</u> It is not clear how much it costs to administer Prize4Life.

<u>Governability:</u> Prize4Life is run by a scientific advisory committee. This seems to be feasible. The chief difficulties with this kind of model are the selection of criteria which are neither too narrow nor too broad, and the setting of the prize amount.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> Prizes of this sort are highly feasible, provided that the funding can be amassed. Prize4Life do not specify the source of their funding.

#### Relation to other proposals
* Prize4Life is a fairly traditional prize fund, where the receipt of the prize once particular medical criteria have been met is unconditional (see Armand Hammer Cancer Prize, Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, Gotham Prize for Cancer Research, The Kochon Prize). This is also true of the Archon Genomics X-Prize.
* More demanding prize models like the TB Prize, the Chagas Prize and the Donor Prize Fund make some form of increased access or distribution a condition of receiving the prize.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Researchers
* Stakeholders on board:
    * Avichai Kremer
    * InnoCentive

## Archon Genomics X-Prize

* Start date: Launched in 2006.
* Description: A $10m prize pot for targets in speed and cost relating to genome sequencing, which was cancelled because it was deemed not to be incentivising innovation.
* Status: Rejected.

### Summary
The Archon Genomics X-Prize was launched in 2006 with a $10m prize pot. The prize was to be given to the first team that could sequence 100  human genomes for $10,000 or less per genome.

In 2013 the prize was cancelled, as independently of the prize, genome sequencing technology was getting faster and cheaper. The prize was thus deemed not to be incentivising the innovation it had set out to, and was cancelled.

> A little more detail here would be interesting. What was the state of sequencing when it was cancelled (was anyone close to winning) [name=Rufus Pollock]

### Notes
#### Strengths and weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> The Archon Genomics X-Prize was targeted at a specific technical achievement in early stage research.

<u>Access:</u> The prize would be awarded for a reduction in the cost of research, which would not necessarily have a bearing on subsequent treatments or their distribution.

<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are not tied to health impact. The strength of the incentive was weaker than the market forces operaing in this field, which is why the prize was cancelled.

<u>Efficiency:</u> This prize was not efficient, as it failed to incentivise for the sum provided.

<u>Governability:</u> The prize was administered by a Scientific Advisory Board. It is an example of the difficulty in measuring the appropriate level of prize funding.

<u>Political Feasibility:</u> It was politically feasible to set up the prize pot, but no teams registered to take part in the competition because the incentives were too weak.

#### Relation to other proposals
* The Archon Genomics X-Prize was a prize for a technical challenge. Both the TB and the Chagas prize proposals incorporate technical challenge prizes, and some of Prize4Life's prizes also relate to the accomplishment of a particular technical feat.
* Like Prize4Life and others (see Armand Hammer Cancer Prize, Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, Gotham Prize for Cancer Research, The Kochon Prize), the Archon Genomics X-Prize had no relation to access. In the case of the genomics prize, this is more structural than in other cases, as the prize was for early stage research and it would therefore have been inappropriate to tie it to health impact or distribution.

#### Political strategy
* Targeted at:
    * Researchers and innovators

## [GHIF - Global Health Investment Fund]

* Start date: Launched in 2013.
* Description: A $108 million social impact investment fund designed to provide financing to advance the development of drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other interventions against diseases that disproportionately burden low- and middle-income countries.
* Status: Operational.

> This is a classic impact investment fund if i understand correctly [name=Rufus Pollock]

### Summary
GHIF is an investment fund which finances high potential impact medical R&D opportunities. In practice this means medical innovations that target diseases of the developing world. Potential losses to investors are underwritten by the Gates Foundation and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.

### Notes
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
<u>Scope:</u> GHIF is disease neutral, and only funds late stage development.
<u>Access:</u> GHIF has no bearing on the price or distribution of drugs.
<u>Innovation:</u> Incentives are linked to potential impact, and so are partially linked to health impact itself.
<u>Efficiency:</u> GHIF is a market-based funding mechanism.

> What does market-based mean here? I wonder if we need to get more precise somehow. [name=Rufus Pollock]

<u>Governability:</u> GHIF does not require a particularly complex governance structure. It is subject to the problem of selection.
<u>Political Feasibility:</u> GHIF is supported by a range of governments and funders, and has the potential to attract funding that would otherwise not have been available.

#### Relation to other proposals
* GHIF is an investment fund which targets medical R&D. We have not examined other examples of such a funding mechanism.
